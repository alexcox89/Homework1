### Company Name : [Dynasty](dynasty.com)

### Origins: 2016 New York FinTech startup 

### Founder: David Ma

### Acquired by AppFolio in 2019

#### "As real estateâ€™s most advanced AI company, Dynasty gives firms the tools to run their business through natural language."[^1]

## Summary

"Hi, Lisa...." These are the first words we see as we navigate to dynasty.com, which introduces you to Lisa, a collective series of deep learning algorithms dedicated to irpoving the Property Management process. It could be argued that Lisa is Dynasty, as their platform is entirely made up of this AI system. 

## Competition
[Diffe.rent](https://diffe.rent/) - AI rental solutions 
 
 [ZenPlace](https://www.linkedin.com/company/zenplace/) - Rental streamlining through cloud-based data 

## Integrations: 

### AppFolio (Parent company), Santa Barbara, CA - 
Used to communicate, set meetings, and streamline services between property managers, prospective lessees, and current tenants.

### ROCO Real Estate, Detroit, MI -
Raised occupancy to profitable levels, Standardized process across 104 properties, and provided better data for property management software.[^2]

### DIICO Properties, Beverly Hills, CA -
Guaranteed response to 100% of prospects, and Lowered workload for traveling lease agent team.[^3]

## Results: 
Dynasty Lisa is simply (and perhaps not so simply) an AI tool for interaction between lessee and lesser on the scale of property management. 

Yet we all know how frustrating it can be to interact with or request services from management for issues involving a particular property. 

Lisa seems to be scaled primarily for sales, meetings, and rent management at this time. It would be interesting to see how this same platform might be scaled for services that benefit the tenant more, such as streamlined repairs and maintenance on individual properties.

Overall however, this seems to be the next big thing in property management.
